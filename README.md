ConnectFourFiles
================

My first coding experience was to create a command line version of Connect Four in python.

From then on, every new programming language I have needed to learn, I have used this project as a means of learning the language (where it has been possible to do so!).

In this repository, you will find all my efforts contained in folders named by the corresponding language.

Please note that this was a learning process for me. Whilst the programs should all run, they may contain bugs.
They are also not meant to be examples of good programming. The aims were to understand the basics of a language. I have included comments in my code where I have remembered to do so, but if there aren't any I'm sorry, I probably removed them because they weren't PG-13.
