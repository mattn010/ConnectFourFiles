ConnectFourFiles
================

My first coding experience was to create a command line version of Connect Four in python.

From then on, every new programming language I have needed to learn, I have used this project as a means of learning the language.

In this repository, you will find all my efforts contained in folders named by the corresponding language.

Please note that this was a learning process for me. Whilst the programs should all run, they may contain bugs.
They are also not meant to be examples of good programming. It was a learning process to understand the basics of a language.
(It was also a chance for me to learn the ins and outs of GitHub!)
